<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Mintango

Mintango is a fun and simple dapp that allows you to mint custom ERC-1155 NFTs that contain a name, description, and image. Once you have minted your new token you can check them out in the "My Goods" section of the dapp.

### Features

* Stores token metadata on IPFS
* Minting fee (this will be controled by a DAO)
* On-chain token up/down voting (an account can vote on a certain token once)
* Backlisting Ethereum accounts to prevent them from minting and voting
* Whitelisting Ethereum accounts to exempt them from paying the minting fee

### Built With

* [React.js][react] v17.0.2+
* [Tuffle ][truffle]
* [Moralis ][moralis]
